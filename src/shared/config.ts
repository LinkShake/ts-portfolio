      "By far the most used programming language in the world, JavaScript it's a great choice because it's easy to learn, intuitive and you can build real world projects without too much problems: maybe this is why it's my favourite language! But the real advantage of using JavaScript in a web project is that you can use it both on the frontend and backend and so share all the code in such an easy way! For bigger apps the go to is absolutely TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript, with a strong type system that helps you catching errors. Because of js' popularity, a lot of frameworks and libraries have been create such as React.js, Svelte, Node.js and Nest.js and so on...",

      "React.js is a frontend JavaScript library for building User Interfaces. This the official page says: but, in my opinion, it's a lot more than that. React, backed with nothing less than Meta(Facebook), is the perfect library for big projects because it lets developers build their own custom component mixing js, HTML and even CSS togheter thanks to JSX(a special js format). It also allows you to use Hooks: special functions to manage state and do a lot more with both built-in and custom hooks you can build to suit your needs. React.js also has the biggest frontend library's ecosystem with tons of frameworks (Next.js, Gatsby...), support for cross-platform mobile development with React Native, a lot of tools (such as React Router, React Query, Redux...) and also some dedicated GraphQL clients (such as Relay).",
